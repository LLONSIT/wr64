# Wave Race 64
A early decompilation of a game with many waves!


```diff
+ Some info +

* This project is very early so for now you can't make any kind of modification, well maybe I'll focus on it soon ;).

* Obviously you need the original rom of the USA Version of Wave Race 64, I am not responsible for which methods you get it.

* About regionalization, currently I am only decompiling the US version, for now I am not interested in the European or Japanese version, maybe I will do it later but for now it's not a priority

```

# Dependencies

- Installing the required dependencies

### Dependencies List

* Capstone
* pip3
* Python
* mips-binutils
* Qemu Irix (Optional)

## Linux

#### Debian/Ubuntu or Wsl Ubuntu

- To install the first 3 dependencies would be:

 `apt-get update ; apt-get install libcapstone-dev python3-pip build-essential`

* Installing Qemu Irix (optional)



`wget https://github.com/n64decomp/qemu-irix/releases/download/v2.11-deb/qemu-irix-2.11.0-2169-g32ab296eef_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i qemu-irix-*.deb`


- Installing the binutils 

```diff
- Warning -

* This point can become something complicated for certain users, so it is recommended to follow the instructions well
```

* First clone the binutils repo
`git clone https://github.com/tj90241/n64chain`

* After cloning the repository and assuming that you're not in the n64chain directory, would be the following

`cd n64chain/tools && bash build-posix64-toolchain.sh binutils`

* Then you need the binutils in your `$PATH`

`echo 'PATH=$PATH:/path/to/n64chain/tools/bin; export PATH' >> ~/.bashrc ; source ~/.bashrc`


# Building


- Cloning the repo

``git clone https://github.com/LLONSIT/wr64.git --recursive``

- installing the splat dependencies and building some tools
 
 `make dependencies`


```diff
- Warning -

* If you cloned the repository without submodules do make extract and then make dependencies and make extract again

```

- Copy the Wave Race 64 USA Rom to ``baserom.z64``

Assuming that you cloned the repository with --recursive

- Run ``make extract ; make``


### Some opts

- If you want to build the repo without ido5.3_recomp, only with qemu_irix
`make USE_QEMU_IRIX=1`


- If you want to use the nrdc to recalculate the CRC, and make a title patch, and the initial code that for wr64 would be NWRE (requires qemu-irix)
`make NRDC=1`
